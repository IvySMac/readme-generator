# README Generator

## Description 
Now that we are shifting gears to back-end development, it's going to take some time to get used to not working in a browser. Through this exercise, I'll
be utilizing node and getting familiar with using it in the terminal. I'll also familiarize myself with using multiple .js files to better organize my code. 

## Usage


You can't have a GitHub project without a good README file! That's why this generator is the perfect tool for every programmer. 

- To start it up, type in ' node app ' in the terminal
- You'll then be prompted with questions
- Once all questions are answered, a README file will be created with all of your inputs
- When you check the README, you'll find a Table of Contents with anchored links
- You'll also see your screenshot image, a license badge, and list of coding language badges
